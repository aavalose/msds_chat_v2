"I had a question about the formatting of the statement of purpose for the MSDS program. I noticed that USF’s MSCS program specifies formatting preferences for the statement of purpose, such as single-spacing and font size, but I couldn’t find similar guidelines for the MSDS program. In my submission, I used double spacing and did not include a title for my SOP. Would that be considered acceptable?","We don't have any specific requirements for the statement formatting, so what you submitted is fine. "
"I had one last question, as an applicant who is currently completing my undergraduate degree, I was wondering if an offer of admissions would include conditional terms? For example, would acceptance be contingent on meeting a certain GPA or would acceptance be contingent on just being able to successfully graduate and receive a Bachelor's degree?","The only condition there could be is completion of an in progress prerequisite, and of course, a conferral of bachelor's degree. GPA is only evaluated at the time of admission review. "
"Is there any assistance you can provide, such as securing Graduate Assistantship sponsorship, to help me fund my chosen course or program, given that I have been informed there is no available funding and I am unable to cover the fees independently?","All admitted candidates will be considered for program scholarships, which will be detailed in the admission letter. No separate application is required. However, please note that our scholarships cover a maximum of 20% of tuition, so students will need to secure additional funding sources for the program.  You can check the Program Overview (https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/programs/graduate/data-science/program-overview) and FAQs (https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/programs/graduate/data-science/faqs) for additional information.

"
"Given that I am an international student, are there any additional forms of financial aid at USF that I may be eligible for, aside from the Double Dons scholarship, which I have already been awarded?","Unfortunately the Double Dons award cannot be stacked with another USF scholarship award, so external scholarships or private loans would be the other financing options for international students. "
"If additional financial aid is not available, I am considering deferring my admission by a year. Could you provide guidance on the process for deferring admission? Specifically, should I still make the $2,000 initial payment by February 15th of this year, even if I plan to defer?","Regretfully, we do not defer admissions offers. However, applicants who have been admitted once are likely to be admitted again in the subsequent year, should they need to turn down the offer and reapply. "
"I attended last week's on-campus event and am seeking advice on my application. I'm currently completing prerequisite courses at three different universities, with most concluding around April. How might this impact my application, and what steps do you recommend I take?","Completing your prerequisite courses by April will not negatively impact your application. You can proceed with your application, but it’s important to note that any admission decision will be contingent upon the successful completion of these courses. I recommend submitting transcripts or proof of enrollment for these courses along with your application and ensuring all final transcripts are submitted as soon as the courses are completed. "
"I am currently a refugee in the US, and is there any financial grant that the USF provides to refugees?","While USF does not have a specific grant exclusively for refugees, you may want to explore external funding opportunities, as well as federal financial aid options, if eligible. Also, I encourage you to reach out to the Financial Aid Office at financialaid@usfca.edu for guidance other funding resources that might apply to your situation. "
"After accepting the offer, in addition to submitting the required payment, will I need to provide my physical Green Card or any other specific ID documentation to complete my enrollment?","The university will not ask for a green card or other documentation to complete your enrollment. However, once the students are matched to their practicum company, the company's HR may require social security card and/or proof of work authorization as part of their onboarding.     "

"I plan to fund my studies through a combination of my father’s support and a student loan. However, the required documents, such as bank statements and loan approval, will be processed based on the scholarship I receive. Given this situation, is it possible to submit the financial documents after admission, or is it mandatory to provide them now?","Yes we can move your application forward for review without the complete Certificate of Finance if you are planning to apply for a loan and require the admission letter for your loan application.  Please upload any financial documents that you have into the Certificate of Finance section of the application, as well as a statement explaining that you intend to apply for a student loan but require the admission letter for your loan application.  When our Graduate Admission Office process your application we will then move it forward for review even if the COF is outstanding.
