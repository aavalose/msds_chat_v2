They enhanced early disease detection for more than 5,000 patients by developing hierarchical segmentation pipelines with encoder-driven transformer models, resulting in an 8% accuracy improvement through XGBoost. Fine-tuned embedding models like GritLM and GIST, combined with Mistral-7B and LLaMA architectures, were applied to refine glioma patient note clustering and expand vocabulary. At the AAPM Conference, the team, as first authors, demonstrated that while baseline MPT-7B and ClinicalBERT models did not inherently improve EHR notes' predictive accuracy, fine-tuning ClinicalBERT achieved F1 scores between 0.81 and 0.91, AUROC between 0.79 and 0.87, and a 6% accuracy improvement over the baseline. Additionally, they led a study to boost LLM performance for classification tasks in healthcare, developed a pipeline for identifying high-risk patients using fine-tuned open-source LLMs, and processed clinical text to create templated summaries using GPT-4. Their retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework, which used kNN clustering on patient embeddings, improved classification accuracy and F1 scores by 25% on a testing set of 500 samples, competing with fine-tuned ClinicalBERT metrics. They also experimented with long-context tuned versions of MPT-7B, LLaMA-2, and LLaMA-3, focusing on sequence parallelism and quantization for multi-GPU inference. The abstract was selected as \"Best in Physics\" for the AAPM conference in July 2024."
